# Exercise - 12 Solution

1. Start the challenge by writing in your bash:

   `git start forge-date`

2. Simply start with `git commit --amend` and just add `--date="1987"` to forge-date as it was committed in 1987. So, the final command is
    ```
    git commit --amend --date="1987" --no-edit
    ``` 
    * `--no-edit` is just for opting to not change the last commit message.

3. Lastly, `git verify` to complete the challenge.
