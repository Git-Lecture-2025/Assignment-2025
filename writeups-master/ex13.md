# Exercise - 13 Solution

1. Start the challenge by writing in your bash:

   `git start fix-old-typo`

2. Enter the interactive mode of git rebase through:
    ```
    git rebase -i HEAD~2
    ```
    `HEAD~2` because we want our last two commits to be changed.
3. It opens a text-editor mode where it's written in the format like:
    ```
    pick 14hf32 commit name
    pick 1243f3 commit name 2
    ```
    * Replace pick with edit for the commit you want to stop and make changes , here we change pick to edit on second last commit (top one in our case).

4. Open the **_file.txt_** and make the required change from **"Hello wordl"** to **"Hello world"**.
5. ```
    git add file.txt
    git commit --amend
    git rebase --continue
    ```
    to commit the change and move to the next commit.
6. It will produce merge conflicts which we to manually resolve by opening `file.txt` and keeping the content of next commit (removing the previous one) and also keeping the change of **"Hello wordl"** to **"Hello world"**.
7. `git add file.txt` for the merge resolution.
8. `git rebase --continue` to complete the rebase process.
9. Lastly, `git verify` to complete the challenge.
