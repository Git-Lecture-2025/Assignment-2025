# 1st exercise
In the 1st exercise I used the following commands
```shell
$ git init
```
which creates a .git file that is then being staged for commit and pushed using the below commands
```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -s -S -m "add a .git and markdown file"
$ git push
```
Thus it is being pushed and verified as well because of the gpg sign
