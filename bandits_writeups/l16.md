# Bandits Level 16
```
nmap localhost -p31000-32000 -sV -T4
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
#obtains a private rsa key
exit #back to local device
echo "--contents of the private key--" > key.pem
chmod +600 key.pem
ssh -i key.pem bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
```

- use `nmap` on the range of ports as given in the question
- switch -sV gives the information about the service provided by the port
- switch T4 speeds up the scanning process
- we get a private rsa key
- save it to a file with appropriate permission in the local device
- setting permission to 600
- then establish ssh connection on bandit17 user using the key.
