```nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000```
1. Commands 
   - `nmap` : used to scan networks
   - `-sV` : detects service and version running on the ports
2. It outputs a list of active ports with the protocol and services running on it. We choose the `ssl/unknown` one which is port number `31790`
   
```ncat --ssl localhost 31790```
```openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 (having trouble)```

3. I was having trouble with `openssl` as it was stuck on `KEYUPDATE` so prefer `ncat` in this case.
