# Bandits Level 6

```
cd /
cat $(find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -type f 2>/dev/null)
```

- First changing to /(root) directory because as hinted that the file is "somewhere" on the server.
- `-user` and `-group` finds the files with user bandit7 and group bandit6.
- 2>/dev/null redirects the error messages due to no permission to the dump so that the correct file is visible.
