# Git Exercises - commit-one-file-staged 
```
git start commit-one-file
```
**Level Description ->** There are two files created in the root project directory - `A.txt` and `B.txt`. They are both added to the staging area.

The goal is to commit only one of them.
```
git reset A.txt #removes one file from the staged area
git commit -sS -m "add level 3"
git verify
```
